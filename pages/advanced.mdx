The "endpoints" section is a vital section of the FaceTime API documentation, focusing on the detailed documentation of the API endpoints available for developers. This section provides comprehensive information about each endpoint, including their purpose, supported operations, request parameters, and expected responses.

Inside the "endpoints" section, you will find individual documentation files for each endpoint, organized in a structured manner. These files offer in-depth explanations and examples to guide developers in understanding and utilizing the API endpoints effectively.

Each endpoint documentation file typically includes the following sections:

- **Endpoint Description:** This section provides an overview of the endpoint's purpose and functionality. It explains the specific task or action that the endpoint is designed to perform.

- **HTTP Method:** This section specifies the HTTP method (such as GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE) used to interact with the endpoint.

- **Response: This** section outlines the structure and format of the response returned by the endpoint. It includes details about the response status codes, response body structure, and example responses.

By exploring the "endpoints" folder in the FaceTime API documentation, developers gain valuable insights into the available endpoints, their functionalities, and how to interact with them effectively. They can refer to the specific documentation file for an endpoint they wish to utilize and follow the provided instructions and examples to integrate the API into their applications successfully.

The "endpoints" folder in the FaceTime API documentation serves as a comprehensive reference, providing developers with all the necessary information to interact with the API endpoints correctly, make requests, handle responses, and build applications that leverage the FaceTime API's capabilities.
