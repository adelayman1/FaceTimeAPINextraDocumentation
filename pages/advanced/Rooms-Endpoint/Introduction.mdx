# Introduction

The Room Endpoints provide a set of APIs for managing calling rooms and performing various operations related to room management. These endpoints enable users to create, join, and manage rooms for video calls.

With these endpoints, developers can incorporate video calling functionality into their applications, facilitating real-time communication and collaboration among users. The Room API supports essential features such as creating new rooms, joining existing rooms, retrieving room information, managing participants, and more.

To get started, users need to have an active account, which can be verified through the provided verification process. Once the account is verified, users can access the Room Endpoints and utilize the following operators:

Create New Room: Create a new calling room where users can initiate video calls and invite participants.
- Join To Room: Join an existing room to participate in ongoing video calls and collaborate with other participants.

- Delete Created Room: Delete a room that was previously created by the user, removing it from the system.

- Get Room Information: Retrieve detailed information about a specific room, including its participants, call history, and settings.

- Get Your Rooms: Retrieve a list of rooms associated with the user's account, providing an overview of their created and joined rooms.

These operators allow developers to build powerful video calling applications that enhance real-time communication and enable seamless collaboration among users. By leveraging the Room Endpoints, developers can create engaging and interactive experiences for their users.

It's important to note that all requests to these endpoints require an active and verified account. Users must complete the account verification process before accessing and utilizing the Room Endpoints.
